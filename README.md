## Codeworks Chat App Assignment

The coding assignment I was assigned to complete to enroll to the Codeworks Software Engineering Course was a very basic and simple chat app, which on one end the computer is to generate messages (not needed to be accurately responsive) which are displayed to the user. In contrast, the user should be able to post messages which can displayed in a chat window with the time the message was sent.

The .zip file I have included in this repository is the precise version of my application that I submitted to Codeworks which was approved and accepted on my first attempt. However, I was highly reccomended that I only amend the following:

> * Improve position/alignment of chat window and elements. Ensure not too much padding is used.
> * Remove console.logs from code before submitting assignments **[RECTIFIED]**

### Chat App Assignment Requirements

* On one side the computer will generate a random conversation, on the other side the user can post messages.
 
* The screen should automatically flow and follow the messages posted, like in all chat apps.
 
* Each message should have an indication of the date and time it was sent.

 
* Your CSS needs to be clean.
 
* Use 3 separate files: one for CSS, one for HTML, and one for JavaScript.

* Use jQuery to interact with the DOM.

* If your submission contains multiple lines of code taken from any online sources (like code snippets, articles, tutorials, AI tools, etc.) add a comment citing that work. Copying code without attribution will disqualify you.
